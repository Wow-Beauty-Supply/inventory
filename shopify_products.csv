jamaican-black-castor-oil-extra-dark-by-sunny-isle,Jamaican Black Castor Oil EXTRA DARK 8oz by SUNNY ISLE,"<p>Our Extra Dark Oil, as the name implies, has the most Ash Content.</p><p>It is thick and rich and is the most effective Oil for all your Hair and Skin conditions. Sunny Isle Extra Dark Jamaican Black Castor Oil is processed the traditional way. Our Organic seeds are roasted and ground by a manual Grinder and then the crushed beans are boiled to extract the 100% pure, dark brown, organic oil. It's the best quality oil on the market. Why you may ask? Compared to other brands it is the darkest Jamaican Black Castor Oil because we roast our beans longer which produces more Ash Content in our oil than any other oil on the market. More ash content increases the effectiveness of the oil. Therefore the Sunny Isle brand will strengthen and increase the length of your hair faster than any other brands on the market today.</p><p>Sunny Isle Jamaican Black Castor is the ONLY Jamaican Black Castor Oil that comes in a safety sealed bottle for your protection.</p><p></p><p><strong>How To Use Sunny Isle Jamaican Black Castor oil for Hair Growth And As A Moisturizer? </strong></p><p>Apply small amounts of Sunny Isle Jamaican Black high quality castor oil daily to the roots and scalp of your hair.</p><p>Then massage the oil into your scalp using your fingertips.

You will see results in two weeks after date of usage.</p><p>Sunny Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil for Eyelash and Eyebrow Growth Sunny isle Jamaican Black castor oil will help your Eyelashes and Eyebrows to grow thicker and longer, and keep them from breaking. It also helps you grow new eyebrow hair in bare areas that might have been over-tweezed. Massaging a little Sunny Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil over the base of your eyelashes before bed prevents thinning and promotes rapid growth, leading to thicker and fuller longer lashes. Do not use Sunny Isle scented Oils on your eyelashes such as the Lavender Jamaican Black Castor Oil, Ylang Ylang Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Rosemary Jamaican Black Castor Oil because the Essentials Oils we use in these product (Lavender, Rosemary, Ylang Ylang) may irritate your eyes. Only use the unscented Jamaican Black Castor Oil such as the Sunny Isle Extra Dark Jamaican Black Castor Oil and the Sunny Isle Regular Jamaican Black Castor Oil on your eyelashes. How to Use Sunny isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil for Eyebrow and Eyelash Hair Growth Wash your face with a mild soap preferably Sunny Isle Jamaican Black castor oil Soap and remove all traces of makeup from your eyelashes and eyebrows soap and remove all traces of makeup and dirt. Dip the mascara wand or a Qtip into Sunny Isle Jamaican black Castor oil, tapping off any excess oil. It is important to only apply a thin layer, so use a clean tissue to dab away drips from the wand/Qtip if necessary. Brush the oil evenly through your eyebrows from inner to out tip. Then use the wand/Qtip to apply the Sunny isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil to your eyelashes, just as you would mascara, from root to tip. Leave the Sunny Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil on overnight and rinse off with a mild soap, Sunny Isle Jamaican Black castor oil soap, in the morning before you apply your makeup/ moisturizer. Treating Acne Using Sunny Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil Many people are unaware that Sunny Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil has been used in many acne treatments. Sunny Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil treats many kinds of skin problems without drying the skin. Many of the acne treatments bought in store dry out the skin a great deal, as this is a method of slowing down the skins production of sebum. While sebum has been linked to acne, drying out the skin actually leads to even more sebum being produced in the future, which forced the skin to become dependent on the treatment in order to stay clear. Sunny Isle Jamaican Black castor oil treatment, however, is able to prevent the skin from drying out, while still reducing the production of sebum. How to use Sunny Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil to Treat Acne Start by putting a large pot of water on the stove and bringing it to a boil. Once the water is rapidly boiling, take it from the stove and put it on the counter. Make sure that it is in a very sturdy location and that nothing will fall on it. Put a towel over the back of your head, covering both head and face, and allow the steam from the water to hit your face. This will open up your pores and will allow the Sunny Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil to become a much more effective acne treatment. Once this has been completed, rub your face with a washcloth to remove any excess dirt and put a small amount of the Sunny Isle Jamaican Black Castor oil onto the cloth. Any one of our Jamaican Black Castor Oils may be used, but we recommend the use of our Sunny Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil with Ylang Ylang.It has a fabulous stimulating effect on the skin. The Ylang Ylang Essential oil helps to correct the production of sebum (Oil) in the body. Rub this oil all over your face using circular motions and make sure that you get any areas that are giving you trouble. If any areas of your skin are giving you particular problems, make sure that you apply a little bit extra Sunny Isle Jamaican Black Castor oil, especially the one with Ylang Ylang, in order to ensure that you have properly taken care of the area. Once the Sunny isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil is all over your face, keep it on for a few minutes so it can be absorbed into the skin then wash your face with warm water and make sure that all of the oil has been removed from your face. Splash your face with cold water, as this will allow your pores to close up. This is essential for the next step of the Sunny isle Jamaican Black Castor oil Acne Treatment, as you will not want your pores to remain open all night, since they will clog. Once you have washed your face with cold water, dry it off. Apply more Sunny Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil {Recommended Ylang Ylang} acne treatment on your face and let it sit there overnight. Make sure that you put a bit of extra Sunny Isle Jamaican Black castor Oil on any areas that are causing you particular problems. When you wake up, wash your face with a moisturizing soap preferable Sunny Isle Lavender Jamaican Black Castor Oil Moisturizing Soap to prevent the drying of skin.</p>",n/a,NEW,,TRUE,Title,Default Title,,,,,JBC1005,589,shopify,9999,deny,manual,14.99,,TRUE,TRUE,,,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,oz
